## nwHacks 2021 - EatGreen ##

Calling all meat lovers! Our team developed a simple web app that helps individuals to switch their meat-based diet with healthy meat alternatives while maintaining their protein intake. Especially in the midst of COVID-19, we recognize that it has become much harder to keep a healthy lifestyle and wanted to help improve our users' health starting with their diet. For the back end, we used Firebase to store our information in a database, and the front end is developed using React, Material-UI, HTML/CSS.

App Instructions:
